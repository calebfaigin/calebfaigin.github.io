    <p> How Computing Changed Society (Reflection)
"Computing will transform society." That is a phrase that has been around since computers first started, but does it ring true?  The book Blown to Bits is about the computing and how it changes not just singular lives but the way we live as a society.  And like the title of this relections shows computing did change society.  One example of this is the fact that you can now download songs at the SAME quality as the original, and companies can’t do anything about it.  The amount of information put on the internet is so vast that by the time the courts issue a take down its been put up ten more times.  If someone’s favorite series gets taken off of Netflix or Hulu they can find it all online.  Computing changed the way that we view entertainment</p>
