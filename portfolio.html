   <h3> Lightbot reflection</h3>
        <p>Light bot reflection
The computer game lightbot is a simple game about coding a little robot to light up blue tiles, this game was made by coders and because of that it accurately depicts what codings like.  You have to put in different inputs and you receive different outputs, you can even use loops to make your bot repeat.  But with that said it also isn’t like a computer because your goal is different.  In lightbot you only have to light up the tiles, whereas in real life you can have different goal, like making a light turn on or making a motor spin.

<h4>Pair Programing Questions</h4>
<p>1) Writing code in smaller pieces allows you to revise more easily and complete the coding in chunks without having to review massive amounts of coding, it leaves less room for error.</p>
<p>2) Building LEGO’s is a good example of figuring out a difficult problem when an error was made. Much like the program in coding when you build the LEGO creation you can make an error that you don’t notice until you’ve completed the creation. This forces you to backtrack to discover mistakes.</p>
<p>3) Our group thinks that the processors have multiple programs opened at once and cycles through the commands of each program in order and continues to do this at a fast pace giving the illusion that multiple programs are being ran at once.</p>
