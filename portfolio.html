    <h3> Lightbot reflection</h3>
        <p>Light bot reflection
The computer game lightbot is a simple game about coding a little robot to light up blue tiles, this game was made by coders and because of that it accurately depicts what codings like.  You have to put in different inputs and you receive different outputs, you can even use loops to make your bot repeat.  But with that said it also isnâ€™t like a computer because your goal is different.  In lightbot you only have to light up the tiles, whereas in real life you can have different goal, like making a light turn on or making a motor spin.
